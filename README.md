#Facial Recognition Application

##full-stack web application using react, nodejs, express, and a postgresql relational database

##users may create an account which has information stored in the database. Then, users may submit images to the application, and the application will determine if there are any faces in the image submitted. It keeps a running tally of how many image submissions each individual user has made, and this is stored in the database. 

##overall, quite simplistic and not production ready, and not really useful, but was a valuable learning experience.

Credit goes to Andrei Neagoie for the Udemy course that walked through the creation of this project.

Looking to expand upon these concepts to create a more sophisticated full-stack web application. Stay tuned.
